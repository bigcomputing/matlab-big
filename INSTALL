Requirements
------------

  1) Matlab 7.0 or later

  2) Big server (http://github.com/bigcomputing/big-server)
  You'll want to have a Big server installed and running on some
  machine that you can connect to, but it doesn't need to be installed on a
  client machine.

Unix Installation
------------------

  First, untar the file:

    % tar xzvf matlab-big.tar.gz

  You can do this as an unpriviledge user, even if you plan to install it as root.

  Second, set MATLABPATH to point to where nws is installed.  
  You might want to add this in your .bashrc or .cshrc file, so you
  don't need to retype this for each login.

  For example, if nws is installed in /usr/local/nws:

    % MATLABPATH=/usr/local/nws:$MATLABPATH
    % export MATLABPATH

  or if you're using a csh-compatible shell:

    % setenv MATLABPATH /usr/local/nws:$MATLABPATH

  Third, if you are planning to use the Sleigh package, 
  make sure you do the following two steps:
  1) make sure you can login to the appropriate remote machines using ssh without a password.

  After setting up password-less ssh, you can do a simple test to see if your
  ssh is setup correctly by typing the following:

    % ssh host date

  If you have setup ssh correctly, this command should display the date on the
  remote machine without asking for password.

  2) Add the location of MATLAB to PATH or MatlabProg environment variable
  on all worker nodes.
  For example,
   
   % PATH=/usr/local/matlab/bin:$PATH
   % export PATH
   or
   % MatlabProg=/usr/local/matlab/bin
   % export MatlabProg

  Note (1): The copy of MATLAB picked up from MatlabProg environment variable supercedes 
  the copy of MATLAB picked up from the PATH environment variable.


Windows Installation
---------------------

  First, unzip the file

  Second, set MATLABPATH to point to where nws is installed.

  Third, if you will be using the Sleigh package, use web launch instead of ssh
  launch to start the sleigh workers. For more information on the Sleigh package,
  please consult the provided tutorials and manual.


Mac OS X Installation
---------------------

  First, mount the disk image file.

  Second, drag the matlab-big directory to the desired location.

  Third, set MATLABPATH to point to the location of matlab-big.
