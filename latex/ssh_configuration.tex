\section{Setting Up a Password-less SSH Login}
\begin{itemize}
\item To generate public and private keys, follow the steps below:
\begin{itemize}
\item Open a terminal (shell on UNIX and DOS prompt on Windows).
\item \texttt{ssh-keygen -t rsa} \\ (assume ssh-keygen is in your PATH)
\item \texttt{cd .ssh} \\ (.ssh directory is located in your HOME directory,
/home/user on UNIX or Cygwin and
C:$\backslash$Program~Files$\backslash$copssh$\backslash$home$\backslash$user on Windows)
\item \texttt{cp id\_rsa.pub authorized\_keys} \\
This step allows password-less login to local machine. 
\item For all remote machines that you want password-less login, append the content of 
id\_rsa.pub to their authorized\_keys file.
\end{itemize}
\item To test the password-less login, type the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
% ssh hostname date
\end{verbatim}
If everything is setup correctly, you should not be asked for password and the
current date on remote machine will be returned. 
\end{itemize}
